## 📝 Project Overview

**typewrite** is a simple, clean blog platform that allows users to sign up, log in, write posts, comment, and manage their profile — all built from scratch by two developers, mentored end-to-end through real-world practices.

This project was built in 1 month by:

- 👨‍💻 Katty – Backend lead
- 🎨 Gustavo – Frontend lead

## 🚀 Features

- User registration and login (JWT-based authentication)
- Profile view and edit
- Create, edit, and delete blog posts
- Comment system under posts
- Full frontend/backend integration
- Deployment-ready with CI/CD in mind
- Basic test coverage and clean code

## 📁 Project Structure

- **frontend/**: All frontend (React) code and assets.
- **backend/**: Backend (FastAPI) code and APIs.
- **docker-compose.yml**: Docker Compose setup for both FE and BE services.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Install Docker** (if you don't have it already).
2. **Navigate to the root of the repo** (where `docker-compose.yml` is).
3. **Create a .env file based on the .env.example and fill all the variables**
4. **Run all Docker containers**

   ```bash
   docker compose up
   ```

To stop all the containers:

```bash
docker compose down
```

Alternatively, if you want to run each container separately, follow the steps bellow:

### Frontend

If you only need the **frontend** running for local development:

1. Run the following to start the **frontend** in Docker:

   ```bash
   docker compose up frontend
   ```

This will build the **frontend** Docker container and map it to port `5173` on your local machine. After that, navigate to `http://localhost:5173` to access the frontend.

### Backend

1. **Before running the next step, garantee that the .env file is created based on the .env.example and fill all the variables**

You can use any values you prefer — they don't need to match specific credentials, as long as they are consistent with how you intend to run the application locally or in your environment.

2. Run the following to start the **backend** in Docker:

   ```bash
   docker compose up api
   ```

This will build the **backend** and **db** Docker containers and map them to port `8080`, `5432` respectively on your local machine. After that, navigate to `http://localhost:8080` to access the backend.

To explore the API documentation automatically generated by the API, go to `http://localhost:8080/docs` in your browser.

There, you’ll find a complete list of all available API endpoints, along with their request/response formats and the ability to test them directly from the browser.
